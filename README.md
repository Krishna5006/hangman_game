# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The objective is to guess the letters of a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. Each incorrect guess results in the loss of a life, and the game continues until either the word is guessed correctly or all lives are lost.

## Files-
- 'hangman.py': The main script containing the game logic.
- 'hangmanart.py': Contains the ASCII art used for the game stages and the game logo.
- 'hangman_wordlist.py': Contains a list of words used for the game.

## Setup-

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the files.
3. Place the hangmanart.py and hangman_wordlist.py files in the same directory as hangman.py.
